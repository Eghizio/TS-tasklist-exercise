# TS-tasklist-exercise

This repository is created as part of a learning exercise, following the tutorial from the YouTube video:  
[Building a Task List App with TypeScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CBZ6DymX0Y&t=2s).

The goal of this project is to **improve TypeScript skills** and **gain hands-on experience** with TypeScript in a real-world application.

## 📝 About the Project

This is a **task list application** that allows users to manage tasks with a **category-based structure**.  
Users can **add and remove tasks**, organizing them into different categories for better task management.

## 📌 Learning Objectives

- Understanding **TypeScript**
- Implementing typing in a task management app
- Exploring **GitHub Copilot** for AI-assisted coding

This is a **work in progress**, and further improvements will be made as I advance in my learning.

Feel free to explore! 🚀
