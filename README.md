This repository is created as part of a learning exercise, following the tutorial from the YouTube video:  
[Building a Task List App with TypeScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CBZ6DymX0Y&t=2s).

The goal of this project is to **improve TypeScript skills** and **gain hands-on experience** with TypeScript in a real-world application.

## ðŸ“Œ Learning Objectives

- Understanding TypeScript
- Implementing strong typing in a task management app

This is a **work in progress**, and further improvements will be made as I advance in my learning.

Feel free to explore! ðŸš€
